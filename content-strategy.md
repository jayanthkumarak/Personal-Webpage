# Content Strategy & Blog Integration

## Content Philosophy: Person-First, Expertise-Driven

### Core Strategy
- **Lead with personality**: "I'm Jayanth" not "Welcome to my site"

secure their Azure and Microsoft 365 environments."

Follow with 2-3 sentences about:
- Current focus/specialty
- What makes your approach different
