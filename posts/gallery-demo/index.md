# Image Gallery Demo

This post demonstrates the new image carousel and gallery features that have been added to the site.

## Standard Carousel Gallery

The default gallery displays images in a carousel format with navigation buttons and indicators:

::: gallery
![Mountain landscape](./images/demo1.jpg "Beautiful mountain vista at sunset")
![Forest path](./images/demo2.jpg "A winding path through the forest")
![Ocean view](./images/demo3.jpg "Waves crashing on the shore")
:::

## Grid Gallery Layout

You can also display images in a grid layout by specifying the `grid` parameter:

::: gallery grid
![City skyline](./images/demo4.jpg "Modern city architecture")
![Nature close-up](./images/demo5.jpg "Detailed shot of leaves")
![Abstract art](./images/demo6.jpg "Colorful abstract composition")
:::

## Features

The carousel includes:
- **Touch/swipe support** for mobile devices
- **Keyboard navigation** (arrow keys, Home, End)
- **Accessibility features** with ARIA labels
- **Responsive design** that works on all screen sizes
- **Progressive enhancement** - works without JavaScript

## Regular Images

Regular images outside of galleries continue to work as before:

The gallery system is designed to be simple to use while providing a rich interactive experience for readers.
