# Website Enhancement Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines two parallel enhancement tracks for the personal website:
1. **Multimedia Support** - Adding images, videos, and rich embeds to blog posts
2. **Visual Design** - Enhancing the aesthetic appeal while maintaining performance

## Priority: Multimedia First

Based on your guidance, we'll prioritize the multimedia enhancement as the primary project, with visual enhancements as a complementary parallel track.

## Combined Timeline

### Month 1: Foundation
**Week 1-2: Image Pipeline**
- Implement image processing with Sharp
- Create responsive image generation
- Update build.js for asset handling
- Basic image CSS styling (visual track)

**Week 3-4: Video Embeds**
- YouTube embed support with privacy mode
- Lazy loading implementation
- Video facade pattern
- Responsive video CSS (visual track)

### Month 2: Enhancement
**Week 5-6: Rich Content**
- Additional embed types (Twitter, Gists)
- Image galleries
- Typography improvements (visual track)
- Color system implementation (visual track)

**Week 7-8: Polish**
- Performance optimization
- CDN integration (optional)
- Micro-interactions (visual track)
- Accessibility audit

## Quick Start Plan

### This Week's Tasks
1. Create feature branch: `feature/multimedia-support`
2. Install initial dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev sharp markdown-it-container
   ```
3. Create proof-of-concept for image processing
4. Update documentation

### Design Decisions Needed

**Multimedia Questions:**
1. Should images be co-located with posts or in a central assets folder?
2. What image sizes should we generate? (400w, 800w, 1200w suggested)
3. Should we support self-hosted video or YouTube-only initially?
4. Do you want automatic social media card generation?

**Visual Questions:**
1. Do you prefer serif or sans-serif for body text?
2. Should we add a dark mode toggle?
3. How much personality vs. minimalism? (color usage)
4. Fixed header or static navigation?

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: MVP Multimedia (Weeks 1-4)
```
✓ Basic image support in markdown
✓ Image optimization pipeline
✓ YouTube embeds
✓ Updated build process
✓ Author documentation
```

### Phase 2: Visual Foundation (Weeks 2-4, parallel)
```
✓ Typography scale
✓ Color system
✓ Basic transitions
✓ Improved spacing
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-8)
```
✓ Image galleries
✓ Multiple embed types
✓ Advanced CSS layouts
✓ Performance optimizations
✓ Full accessibility audit
```

## Success Criteria

### Multimedia Success
- [ ] Authors can easily add images to posts
- [ ] Images are automatically optimized
- [ ] YouTube videos embed seamlessly
- [ ] Page load time remains <3s
- [ ] Build time stays under 30s

### Visual Success
- [ ] Professional, modern appearance
- [ ] Maintains minimalist philosophy
- [ ] CSS bundle <15KB
- [ ] 100% accessibility score
- [ ] Positive user feedback

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Build time increase**: Mitigate with caching
- **Complexity creep**: Regular code reviews
- **Performance degradation**: Strict budgets

### Design Risks
- **Over-designing**: Stick to enhancement phases
- **Accessibility issues**: Test continuously
- **Browser compatibility**: Progressive enhancement

## Approval Checkpoints

1. **Before Phase 1**: Review this plan ✓
2. **After image POC**: Demo basic functionality
3. **Before Phase 2**: Review visual mockups
4. **After Phase 3**: Full demo before merge

## Questions for You

1. **Content Migration**: Should we update existing posts with images retroactively?
2. **CDN Usage**: Do you have a preferred CDN (Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront)?
3. **Analytics**: Should we track media engagement?
4. **SEO**: How important are social media preview cards?
5. **Future**: Any specific multimedia types you want to prioritize?

## Next Immediate Steps

Once you approve this roadmap:

1. I'll create the feature branch
2. Set up the basic image processing pipeline
3. Create a test post with images
4. Show you a working demo
5. Iterate based on your feedback

The website is currently live at http://localhost:8080 - shall we proceed with implementing Phase 1 of the multimedia support?
