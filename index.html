                    I'm Jayanth Kumar, a security consultant who helps organizations 
                    secure their Azure and Microsoft 365 environments. I work with 
                    clients to harden their cloud environments and perform proactive 
                    security operations and threat hunts.

                        I'm working with clients to understand emerging threats in cloud 
                        environments, particularly around identity and access management. 
                        Recent focus areas include conditional access policies, privileged 
                        identity management, and detecting sophisticated persistence techniques 
                        in Microsoft 365.

                        I'm also seeing organizations struggle with the complexity of 
                        Microsoft's security tooling landscape – there are now dozens of 
                        overlapping security products, and many teams don't know which 
                        tools actually provide value for their specific environment.

                    <p>
                        I've been working in cybersecurity for over a decade, with the last 
                        several years focused specifically on cloud security. I started my 
                        career in traditional network security, but made the shift to cloud 
                        as organizations began their digital transformation journeys.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What I've learned is that cloud security isn't just network security 
                        in the cloud – it requires a fundamentally different approach. Identity 
                        becomes the new perimeter, and understanding the shared responsibility 
                        model is critical to getting security right.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hold several industry certifications and regularly speak at security 
                        conferences, but what I'm most proud of is helping organizations 
                        prevent real attacks and respond effectively when incidents do occur.
