# Information Architecture & Site Structure

## DHH-Inspired Single Page Layout

### Core Philosophy
- **Linear Storytelling**: One cohesive narrative from top to bottom
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Most important information first
- **Minimal Navigation**: Everything accessible through scrolling
- **Content Integration**: Blog posts woven into personal narrative

- **Scroll-based** discovery matches DHH approach

### Secondary Navigation: Minimal
- **Logo/Name**: Returns to top of page
- **"Articles"**: Link to blog archive page
- **Contact**: Jump to contact section or mailto link

### Blog Navigation
- **Archive Page**: Simple chronological list
- **Individual Posts**: Back to home, next/previous post
- **Categories/Tags**: Avoid complexity, use if essential

## URL Structure

### Primary URLs
```
/ (homepage - everything)
/articles/ (blog archive)
/articles/threat-hunting-overview/ (individual posts)
/rss.xml (RSS feed)
```

### SEO-Friendly Post URLs
```
Current: jayanthkumar.com/is-your-team-log-ready/
New: jayanthkumar.com/articles/is-your-team-log-ready/

Maintain existing URLs with redirects where possible
```

## Content Organization Principles

### 1. Personal First, Professional Second
- Lead with human story
- Integrate expertise naturally
- Avoid corporate language

### 2. Current Over Historical
- What you're doing now
- Recent insights and projects
- Less emphasis on past achievements

### 3. Practical Over Theoretical
- Real client challenges
- Actionable advice
- Concrete examples

### 4. Accessible Over Technical
- Explain complex concepts simply
- Use analogies and examples
- Avoid unnecessary jargon

## Responsive Considerations

### Mobile-First Design
- **Single column** layout works perfectly on mobile
- **Large touch targets** for links
- **Readable font sizes** without zooming
- **Minimal horizontal scrolling**

### Desktop Enhancement
- **Optimal line length** for reading
- **Generous margins** for focus
- **Consistent vertical rhythm**
- **Easy scanning** with clear headings

## Content Management Strategy

### Static Content (Main Page)
- **Personal intro**: Update quarterly
- **Current work**: Update monthly

- **Contact**: Rarely changes

### Dynamic Content (Blog)

- **Recent articles**: Auto-generated from posts
- **Archive**: Auto-generated
- **RSS**: Auto-generated

### Publishing Workflow
